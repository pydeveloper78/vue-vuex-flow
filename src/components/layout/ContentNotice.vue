							<li>Easier to Qualify: Because FHA insures your mortgage, lenders 
							may be more willing to give you loan terms that make it easier for you 
							to qualify</li>
							<li>Low Down Payment: FHA loans have a low 3.5% downpayment and 
							that money can come from a family member, employer or charitable 
							organization as a gift</li>
							<li>The Federal Housing Authority (FHA) is the largest issuer of 
							mortgages in the world, insuring over 34 million properties since 1934.</li>
							<li>No Credit: The FHA usually requires two lines of credit for 
							qualifying applicants. If you don't have a sufficient credit history, 
							you can try to qualify through a substitute form.</li>
